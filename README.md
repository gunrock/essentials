**Gunrock/Essentials**[<sup>[1]</sup>](#footnotes) is a CUDA library for graph-processing designed specifically for the GPU. It uses a **high-level**, **bulk-synchronous/asynchronous**, **data-centric abstraction** focused on operations on vertex or edge frontiers. Gunrock achieves a balance between performance and expressiveness by coupling high-performance GPU computing primitives and optimization strategies, particularly in the area of fine-grained load balancing, with a high-level programming model that allows programmers to quickly develop new graph primitives that scale from one to many GPUs on a node with small code size and minimal GPU programming knowledge.

## Quick Start Guide
Before building Gunrock make sure you have **CUDA Toolkit**[<sup>[2]</sup>](#footnotes) installed on your system. Other external dependencies such as `NVIDIA/thrust`, `NVIDIA/cub`, etc. are automatically fetched using `cmake`.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/gunrock/essentials.git
cd essentials
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. 
make sssp # or for all algorithms, use: make -j$(nproc)
bin/sssp ../datasets/chesapeake/chesapeake.mtx
```

## Implementing Graph Algorithms
For a detailed explanation, please see the full [documentation](https://github.com/gunrock/essentials/wiki/How-to-write-a-new-graph-algorithm). The following example shows simple APIs using Gunrock's data-centric, bulk-synchronous programming model, we implement Breadth-First Search on GPUs. This example skips the setup phase of creating a `problem_t` and `enactor_t` struct and jumps straight into the actual algorithm.

We first prepare our frontier with the initial source vertex to begin
push-based BFS traversal. A simple `f->push_back(source)` places
the initial vertex we will use for our first iteration.
```cpp
void prepare_frontier(frontier_t* f,
                      gcuda::multi_context_t& context) override {
  auto P = this->get_problem();
  f->push_back(P->param.single_source);
}
```
We then begin our iterative loop, which iterates until a convergence condition has been met. If no condition has been specified, the loop converges when the frontier is empty.
```cpp
void loop(gcuda::multi_context_t& context) override {
  auto E = this->get_enactor();   // Pointer to enactor interface.
  auto P = this->get_problem();   // Pointer to problem (data) interface.
  auto G = P->get_graph();        // Graph that we are processing.

  auto single_source = P->param.single_source;  // Initial source node.
  auto distances = P->result.distances;         // Distances array for BFS.
  auto visited = P->visited.data().get();       // Visited map.
  auto iteration = this->iteration;             // Iteration we are on.

  // Following lambda expression is applied on every source,
  // neighbor, edge, weight tuple during the traversal.
  // Our intent here is to find and update the minimum distance when found.
  // And return which neighbor goes in the output frontier after traversal.
  auto search = [=] __host__ __device__(
                      vertex_t const& source,    // ... source
                      vertex_t const& neighbor,  // neighbor
                      edge_t const& edge,        // edge
                      weight_t const& weight     // weight (tuple).
                      ) -> bool {
    auto old_distance =
      math::atomic::min(&distances[neighbor], iteration + 1);
    return (iteration + 1 < old_distance);
  };

  // Execute advance operator on the search lambda expression.
  // Uses load_balance_t::block_mapped algorithm (try others for perf. tuning.)
  operators::advance::execute<operators::load_balance_t::block_mapped>(
    G, E, search, context);
}
